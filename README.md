GIT:
Actually using the token
If you already have the repository cloned locally
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://[TOKEN]@github.com/[REPO-OWNER]/[REPO-NAME]
git push
If you are cloning a new repository
git clone https://[TOKEN]@github.com/[REPO-OWNER]/[REPO-NAME]
git push origin --delete main
